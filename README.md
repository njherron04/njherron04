## üè° Personal & Academic Projects
- **TCP Chat Server (Python)** ‚Üí exploring socket programming, client/server models, and multithreaded communication  [TCP Chat Server](https://github.com/njherron04/HomeLab/tree/main/Projects/TCP_Server)
- **DoS Attack Simulation & Defense (Jetstream2)** ‚Üí Simulated SYN-spoof and Slowloris DoS attacks against a Linux Apache VM on Jetstream2; implemented detection with Snort and mitigation using iptables and server hardening (SYN cookies, mod_reqtimeout).
